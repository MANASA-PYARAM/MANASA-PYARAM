Spotify Reviews Sentiment Analysis by Manasa

This project is a heartfelt effort by Manasa, with the dedicated guidance of my mentor Santosh and the constant support of CodTech. Together, we aimed to explore how Natural Language Processing (NLP) could be applied to understand user sentiments on Spotify reviews.

What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence where computers are taught to understand, analyze, and even generate human language. For this project, I focused on applying NLP techniques to analyze and classify sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in Spotify reviews.

How the Project Was Done:

Step 1: Collecting Data
- The first step involved gathering a dataset of Spotify reviews. I ensured it was rich enough to train and evaluate our model effectively.

Step 2: Preprocessing Text
- To make the text suitable for machine learning models, I cleaned it by removing unnecessary characters, numbers, and words that donâ€™t add meaning (stopwords). Tokenization and normalization (like stemming or lemmatization) followed.

Step 3: Exploring Data
- Visualizing sentiment distributions and looking for patterns helped me understand the data better.

Step 4: Extracting Features
- I converted text into numerical representations using TF-IDF and experimented with advanced techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec and GloVe).

Step 5: Building a Model
- Models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and even deep learning techniques such as LSTMs were used. I divided the data into training and testing sets to ensure robust evaluation.

Step 6: Evaluating Performance
- Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. Fine-tuning models made a significant difference in the final outcomes.

Step 7: (Optional) Deployment
- Although optional, I explored deploying the trained model via Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications.

How You Can Explore This Repository:

Prerequisites:
- A working setup of Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.
- Libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and nltk should be installed.

To get started:
1. Clone this repository to your system.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/spotify-reviews-nlp.git
   ```
2. Move into the project folder.
   ```bash
   cd spotify-reviews-nlp
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Running the Project:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook spotify-reviews-sentiment-analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow along with the cells, executing them step-by-step to see how the analysis unfolds.

Exact Code for Running Without Errors:

Ensure the following code is implemented correctly in your notebook or Python script:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('spotify_reviews.csv')  # Replace with your dataset path

# Data preprocessing
data['cleaned_reviews'] = data['reviews'].str.replace(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', regex=True).str.lower()
data['cleaned_reviews'] = data['cleaned_reviews'].str.split()

# Splitting data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    data['cleaned_reviews'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x)),
    data['sentiment'],
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42
)

# Convert text data to numerical data using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Model training
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

What I Achieved:
- Through this project, I visualized sentiment distributions, evaluated model performance, and generated predictions for Spotify reviews.
